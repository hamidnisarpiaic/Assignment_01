The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary
 number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
  such as a color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
